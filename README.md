This project was done in a group where we had to deploy and protect an network infrastructure that would closely resemble something that a medium-sized business would do.
**Services that were deployed are:**
1. Apache Web Service
2. WordPress CMS
3. MySQL Database
4. pfSense
5. SFTP
6. Bind9
7. Nextcloud
8. Web Application Firewall
Zones were created in order to segregate and protect what is more important and crucial to the business. Along with the services, multiple machines were deployed and configured to be secure against attacks that are commonly posed as a threat to medium-sized businesses.
